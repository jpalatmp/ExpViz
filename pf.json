Blessed is \n                         he who, in the name of charity and \n                         good will, shepherds the weak through \n                         the valley of the darkness. For he \n                         is truly his brother's keeper and \n                         the finder of lost children. And I \n                         will strike down upon thee with great \n                         vengeance and furious anger those \n                         who attempt to poison and destroy my \n                         brothers. And you will know I am the \n                         Lord when I lay my vengeance upon \n                         you.\" I been sayin' that shit for \n                         years.  And if you ever heard it, it \n                         meant your ass. I never really \n                         questioned what it meant. I thought \n                         it was just a coldblooded thing to \n                         say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped \n                         a cap in his ass. But I saw some \n                         shit this mornin' made me think twice. \n                         Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're \n                         the evil man. And I'm the righteous \n                         man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the \n                         shepherd protecting my righteous ass \n                         in the valley of darkness. Or is \n                         could by you're the righteous man \n                         and I'm the shepherd and it's the \n                         world that's evil and selfish.  I'd \n                         like that. But that shit ain't the \n                         truth. The truth is you're the weak. \n                         And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But \n                         I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to \n                         be a shepherd."
